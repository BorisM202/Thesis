\chapter{Introduction}

The fraction of irradiation reflected by Earth's surface is called the albedo. It is linked with the composition and properties of the surface and therefore varies throughout the year. The average albedo is between 0.1 and 0.3, and the report made by \citep{garciaclimate} it is possible to refine this ratio for Ireland. The exhaustive dataset provided by ERA5 contains a 'forecast albedo' variables \citep{hersbach2020era5} allows us to perform a statistical average of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. The results is 0.17 for the entire island.
